#assignment (= vs <-)

#why use <- ?

  #you are writing R code before 2001
  #you have a key on your keyboard that types <- (nowadays... alt + -)
  #keep assignment and argument passing separate
  #you want to write idiomatic R

#why use = ?

  #you hate the way <- looks
  #you do not want to use two keys for assignment
  #you use = for every other language (*ahem* c++)

#you decide

  #what is your background?
  #who is your audience?
  #who are you working with?

#BE CONSISTENT!
