  #since linear regression expects a numeric response
  #variable, we coerce the response to be numeric

  #recall that E-hat[Y|X = x] = X * Beta-hat

  #since Y is limited to values of 0 and 1, we have E[Y|X = x] = P(Y = 1|X = x)

  #it would then seem reasonable that X * Beta-hat
  #is a reasonable estimate of P(Y = 1|X = x)

  #we test this on the Default data

    model_lm = lm(default ~ balance, data = default_trn_lm)

  #everything seems to be working, until we plot the results:

  #two issues arise:

    #first, all of the predicted probabilities are below 0.5
    #that means we would classify every observation as a "No"
    #this is certainly possible, but not what we would expect

      all(predict(model_lm) < 0.5) #TRUE

    #the next, and bigger issue, is predicted probabilities less than 0

      any(predict(model_lm) < 0) #TRUE

#bayes classifier

  #why are we using a predicted probability of 0.5 as the cutoff for classification?

  #recall the bayes classifier, which minimizes the classification error:

    #C^B(x) = argmax P(Y = g|X = x)

  #so, in the binary classification problem, we will use predicted probabilities

    #p-hat(x) = P-hat(Y = 1|X = x) and P-hat(Y = 0|X = x)

  #and then classify to the larger of the two

  #we actually only need to consider a single probability, usually P-hat(Y = 1|X = x)

  #since we use it so often, we give it the shorthand notation, p-hat(x)

  #then the classifier is written,

    #C-hat(x) = 1 if p-hat(x) > 0.5
    #C-hat(x) = 0 if p-hat(x) <= 0.5

  #this classifier is essentially estimating the bayes classifier,
  #thus, is seeking to minimize classification errors

#logistic regression with glm()

  #to better estimate the probability p(x) = P(Y = 1|X = x), we turn to logistic regression

  #the model is written

    #log[p(x) / (1 - p(x))] = Beta_0 + Beta_1 * x_1 + Beta_2 * x_2 + ... + Beta_p *x_p

  #rearranging, we see the probabilities can be written as

    #p(x) = 1 / (1 + e ^ -(Beta_0 + Beta_1 * x_1 + Beta_2 * x_2 + ... + Beta_p *x_p))
    #     = sigma(Beta_0 + Beta_1 * x_1 + Beta_2 * x_2 + ... + Beta_p *x_p)

  #notice we use the sigmoid function as shorthand notation,
  #which appears often in deep learning literature

  #it takes any real input, and outputs a number between 0 and 1 (how useful!)

  #(this is actually a particular sigmoid function called the logistic
  #function, but since it is by far the most popular sigmoid function,
  #often sigmoid function is used to refer to the logistic function)

    #sigma(x) = (e ^ x) / (1 + e ^ x) = 1 / (1 + e ^ -x)

  #the model is fit by numerically maximizing the
